# Lidl Drivers for Hubitat

These drivers provide support for some Lidl smart home products sold under their SilverCrest brand.

Only tested with the UK products, but these drivers should work fine with other derivatives. They're rebadged Tuya devices at heart, but I'm handling them separately as there should be at least some degree of standardisation? Maybe?

If nothing else it makes the drivers easier to find.

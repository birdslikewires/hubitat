# Tuya Drivers for Hubitat

These drivers provide support for the smart plug and smart extension from Lidl.  Tested with the UK products, these drivers should work fine with the product range worldwide.

## Instructions

Instructions mostly live [here](https://community.hubitat.com/t/release-tuya-lidl-smart-home-with-presence/60156?u=andydvsn) for the moment, though I should keep them here instead - and I shall when I get around to it!

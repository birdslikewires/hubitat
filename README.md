# Hubitat Drivers

The _Magnum Opus_ of this repo is certainly the [AlertMe](https://github.com/birdslikewires/hubitat/tree/master/alertme) driver section. All of the Zigbee, none of the standards. This stuff was on sale before the book was written. Grab yourself a Hubitat C7 or earlier and your AlertMe / Iris V1 gear is back in action.

For everything else, just click on the driver directory and there may be some documentation. Otherwise it'll live on the post on [Hubitat Community forum](https://community.hubitat.com).

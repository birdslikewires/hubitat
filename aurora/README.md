# Aurora Drivers for Hubitat

<span style="background:#ff4d4f">DEPRECATED</span>

Aurora's range of Zigbee products were discontinued in August 2022. I no longer have access to these devices, so won't be developing this line of drivers any further.

---

These drivers provide support for whichever Aurora AOne devices I've bought.
